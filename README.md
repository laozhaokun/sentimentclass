sentimentclass
==============

A simple Sentiment Detection System.
------------------------------------
After training and testing the prior project,i found a "good" model to classify
the unlabel dataset,so i want to save it and use it . <br/>
It's a java web project,you can directly use it in your Tomcat or Jetty server.<br/>
This is a result of the https://github.com/laozhaokun/sentimentclassify"<br/>
You can see the result page on http://sentimentclass.sinaapp.com/ <br/>
